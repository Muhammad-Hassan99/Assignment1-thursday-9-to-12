        <p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. It enables developers to write more robust and maintainable code by catching potential errors during development rather than at runtime. TypeScript's type system ensures that variables, functions, and objects have predictable behaviors, helping developers avoid common issues such as type mismatches. It also supports modern JavaScript features, making it compatible with existing JavaScript codebases. As TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, it can run in any environment where JavaScript runs, such as browsers and Node.js. By providing better tooling, improved code refactoring, and comprehensive editor support, TypeScript has become a popular choice for building large-scale applications in both frontend and backend development.</p>
